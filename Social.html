    <head>🌞☄️ Formation of the Sun and Planets–One Big Story!</head>
    <p>Around 4.6 billion years ago, our solar system was just a huge cloud of gas and dust floating in space. Everything we see today—the Sun, planets, moons, asteroids—all formed from this single cloud!</p>
    <h1> The Solar Nebula – The Beginning of Everything ☁️</h1>
   <li>A giant cloud of gas and dust (called a solar nebula) existed in space.</li>
   <li>A shockwave from a nearby exploding star (a supernova) disturbed the cloud.</li>
   <li>This caused the nebula to collapse under its own gravity and start spinning.</li>
   <h2>Birth of the Sun – The Center of It All 🌞</h2>
   <li>As the nebula spun, most of the gas gathered at the center.</li>
   <li>The gas became hot and dense, eventually starting nuclear fusion-this what makes the Sun shine! 😊☀️</li>
   <li>This is how our Sun was born, becoming a massive ball of burning hydrogen!</li>
   <h3>Formation of Planets🪐</h3>
   <li>The remaining gas and dust did not fall into the Sun. Instead, it spread out into a flat disk around it.</li>
   <li>Small particles started sticking together to form bigger and bigger objects.</li>
   <li>Over millions of years, these clumps became the planets.</li>
   <b>Why Are Planets So Different?</b>
   <u>Inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars)</u>
   <li>Formed close to the Sun, where it was too hot for gas and ice.</li>
   <li>Made mostly of rock and metal.</li>
   <u>Outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune)</u>
   <li>Formed farther away, where it was cold enough for gases like hydrogen and helium to stay.</li>
   <li>Became huge gas and ice giants.</li>
 <p><b><i> So this is how the Sun☀️ and Planets🪐 formed</i></b></p>
