<h2>The Life Cycle of Stars</h2>
<p>
    A star ✨’s life begins in a nebula ☁️, where gas and dust collapse to form a protostar 🌟. It then becomes a main sequence star, shining for billions of years. When it runs out of fuel ⛽, it expands into a red giant 🔴 or supergiant and eventually dies 💥, leaving behind a white dwarf ⚪, neutron star 🪐, or black hole ⚫..</p>
    <h3>How did earth form?</h3>
    <p>Earth 🌍 formed 4.5 billion years ago from a cloud ☁️ of gas and dust called the solar nebula. Gravity 🌀 pulled particles together, creating a growing planet, while heat 🔥 caused heavier elements to sink to the core. Collisions 💥 and volcanic 🌋 activity shaped the surface, forming the oceans 🌊 and atmosphere.</p>
