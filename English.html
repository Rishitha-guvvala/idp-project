    <h1>The Big Bang: How Our Universe Began</h1>
    <p>
        The Big Bang Theory is the most widely accepted explanation of how the universe started. Scientists believe that the universe began 13.8 billion years ago from a single, tiny, and hot ball of <br>gases. Then, suddenly, it exploded and started expanding—this was the Big Bang! 💥

        We’ve all wondered how this universe began. Well, it’s all about the Big Bang Theory. This theory states that the universe began as a tiny, dense point that exploded, creating matter and space. As the explosion settled, particles, dust, and tiny pieces of rocks came together, leading to the creation of stars ✨, planets 🪐, and galaxies 🌌.
        
        Scientists use powerful telescopes 🔭, like the James Webb Space Telescope, to study distant galaxies and learn about the universe’s early days. The cosmic microwave background—a faint glow left from the Big Bang—also helps prove this theory.
        
        The universe is so huge that we can’t even measure its full size! The part we can see is about 93 billion light-years across, but scientists believe it might go on forever. 🚀
        
        There are more than two trillion galaxies in the observable universe, and each galaxy has millions to trillions of stars. Our galaxy, the Milky Way 🌌, is just one of them.
        
        The universe is mostly made up of dark matter and dark energy, which are mysterious and invisible. Only 5% of the universe is made of normal stuff like stars, planets, and people! 🏠🌍
        
        The Big Bang Theory helps us understand how everything in the universe began and continues to evolve. Although scientists have learned a lot, many mysteries remain about dark matter, dark energy, and the true size of the universe. With advanced technology and powerful telescopes, we are constantly uncovering new secrets about space. 🌠 The more we explore, the closer we get to answering one of the biggest questions—how did it all begin, and what will happen in the future? 🤔🔭
